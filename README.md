# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical stock market data. The dataset used in this analysis contains historical prices and trading volumes for a specific stock. The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can forecast future stock prices and help investors make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is collected from financial market data providers and includes daily stock prices and trading volumes. It contains features such as open price, close price, high price, low price, and trading volume for each trading day.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main parts:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: In this part, we load the stock price dataset and perform an initial exploration of the data. We visualize the historical stock prices, analyze the distribution of the target variable (stock price), and identify any trends or patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the data by handling missing values, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and scaling the features if necessary.

3. **Data Visualization**: We create visualizations, such as time series plots and candlestick charts, to understand the stock price trends and any seasonality or patterns in the data.

4. **Model Building**: We train machine learning models for stock price prediction, such as time series models (ARIMA, LSTM) or regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest).

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess their predictive performance.

## Dependencies

The project is implemented using Python and relies on libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and Keras (for deep learning models).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the `Dependencies` section using `pip`.
3. Place the stock price dataset (CSV file or obtain data through APIs) in the appropriate directory.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` and run each cell sequentially.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we aim to provide stock price prediction models that can aid investors in making informed decisions. By analyzing historical stock market data and using machine learning techniques, we can forecast future stock prices and identify potential investment opportunities. This Model obtained an r2_score of 0.99. The project can be extended to include more advanced time series models, feature engineering, and sentiment analysis for better predictions.
